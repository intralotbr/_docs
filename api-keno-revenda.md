# API Description

This API allow you to connect with Keno Revenda system.

The test environment URL is:

- https://revenda.kenominas.com.br/beta/ - Dashboard

- https://revenda.kenominas.com.br/beta/api - API Endpoint

The production environment URL is:

- https://revenda.kenominas.com.br/ - Dashboard

- https://revenda.kenominas.com.br/api - API Endpoint


*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
This API is still under development and currently are in beta testing. Production environments are not ready.


## Account Types

The API was built with 2 accounts type in mind:

- Distributor - Accounts which will register tickets in their own name. Those accounts work with a credit limit and once per week an invoice is generated with the balance between tickets cost and tickets prizes.
- Reseller - Accounts which will register tickets for customers. After sending a ticket purchase request to the API, those account will receive a PIX QR Code for payment, after the payment is identified by our system, the ticket is then generated and sent back to the seller. Prizes are automatically sent to the given PIX DICT Key.

__Regardless the account type, prizes which requires Tax Retention, will require manual review from our side. If you are a Distributor, at that point you will need to inform detailed information about the ticket owner for prize payment through our Back Office, this ticket prize will not count in the weekly invoice, but it's cost will.__


## Authentication

All requests to the API should be sent as a regular application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST request. Every request must inform the authentication details, as follow:

- account_id : Your account ID found at the Dashboard
- key : The API key found at the Dashboard

Endpoins which accept additional arguments, should use:
- payload : A JSON encoded object containing all the expected variables.

Besides the API Key authentication, you should also whitelist your origin IPs at the Dashboard. Doing so will guarantee that only your IPs can act at your behalf.

## API Limitations

Currently we don't impose limits or throttle requests ratio on our API. 

TBI/TBD - API Block and Throttling due to multiple requests.

## Webhooks 
You can setup a public reachable URL on the options for the Webhook functionality. This URL must be secured by a valid SSL. After activating an URL, we'll send every future notification to that URL.

We expect a header response status 200 to consider the notification as sent. In case of failure, we'll try to re-submit it 2 other times, after a few seconds. Most of the notifications are time-sensitive, for this reason we don't intend to create large intervals between notifications. If your application relies on a notification to work, you must ensure to have a fallback which will query the notifications endpoint to check for any non-submitted notification.

### Authenticating the Notification

Every notification submission will have a header 'Digital-Signature', this digital signature can be verified using our Public Key found at the /public-key endpoint.

### Notifications

The notification will be sent as body POST to your URL. It will always be a JSON Encoded string with a few elements. Each notification have a specific structure as showed below, but all of them share at least 2 variables:

## Understanding Order Flow

![order flow](https://revenda.kenominas.com.br/beta/assets/img/order-flow.jpeg)


## Error Handling
While reading the response you should always check the Header Status Code. A code different from 200 means that you have an error on your request and it wasn't processed.
You may get the body response text to get more information about  the error, it's always returned as a JSON object with a single variable. Example:
```json
{
    "message": "Not enough credits"
}
```
